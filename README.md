The python script uses Selenium to open a website, then it continuously scrolls down the page until it finds a 'Back to Top' button. It identifies image tags, filters them for the highest quality images and their names, and saves these image files. This downloading process is handled in parallel using a ThreadPoolExecutor for efficiency. The script can be applied to a custom URL by simply modifying the URL variable in the script.
